| 1           | Introduction to Node Js        | "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."  **Jeff Atwood, 2007**             | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2001%20Introduction%20to%20Node%20Js/Readme.md)     |
| 2           | Js on the Server   | Think of a server as a computer located remotely, waiting to handle your requests!                 | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2002%20Js%20on%20the%20Server/Readme.md)     |
| 3           | Let's Write Code           | This episode dives into writing our first backend code, exploring Node.js, and understanding some essential concepts like the **Global Object**. Here's everything you need to know to get started!                                          | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2003%20Let's%20Write%20Code/Readme.md)                          |
| 4           | module.export & require           | Node.js treats every file as a **module**, allowing you to share and reuse code effectively. This episode covers everything from importing/exporting modules to handling nested modules and understanding strict vs. non-strict mode.                                        | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2004%20module.export%20&%20require/Readme.md)                          |
| 5           | Diving Into Node Js Github Repo           | Let’s uncover the magic behind `require` and how Node.js handles modules under the hood!                                      | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2005%20Diving%20Into%20Node%20Js%20Github%20Repo/Readme.md)                          |
| 6           | Understanding Node.js Event-Driven Architecture & Libuv           | Node.js is **event-driven** and supports **asynchronous I/O operations**, making it efficient for handling multiple tasks without blocking the main execution thread.                                     | [📄 View Notes](./Episode%2006%20libuv%20&%20async.io/Readme.md)                          |
